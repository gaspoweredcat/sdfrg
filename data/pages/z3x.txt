Z3X Box is a very reliable and relatively user friendly solution for flashing and unlocking of Samsung and LG devices, for Samsung devices there is also a built in firmware downloader should the file not be available on the flash file server. LG firmware can also be downloaded through the shell application but it is not yet integrated into the application like the Samsung version

Unlike samsung tool this application does not have separate tabs for each function, double clicking the model will open the Workspace tab where all operations will be displayed as buttons on the right of the window.

Thankfully unlike samsung tool LG tool does not have nearly as many variances in the way it unlocks devices, almost all LG devices are handled via diagnostic mode (*#546368#*ModelNo#/277634#*# and select port check test) or download mode (hold Volume down and connect usb to device while powered off)
