====== XTC2 Clip ======
\\ 
XTC2 clip is used for HTCs 2nd gen and on devices (2013 and on) it works by mimicking HTCs factory java card, This means it is able to perform almost any operation using the official methods as used by HTC.
\\ 
===== Gen2 - Up to M8s =====
\\ 
  - Insert card into the devices micro SD slot (if there is no micro SD connect to a card reader and Y cable)
  - Boot the device into bootloader by holding Volume down and power
  - Once the phone has scanned the card scroll down and select the "SIMLOCK"option
  - The device will now scan the card, reboot and scan again to set S-Off and CID to Generic European
  - You can now flash the device as needed
  - once you have finished all operations set S-On via fastboot command: //htc_fastboot.exe oem writesecureflag 3//
\\ 
===== Gen 3 - M9 and above =====
\\ 
From gen 3 a new bootloader was introduced, it is split into bootloader, download and FTM modes and the SIMLOCK menu has been removed as such it has to be handled differently.
