<div class="level1">

<p>
<br/>

Combination files are Samsung factory engineering flash files, they contain a very limited set of apps and functionality but due to them containing engineering modem files and a permissive kernel they are very useful for unlocking and other operations.<br/>

</p>

<p>
Once you have finished the operations you need to do remember to flash the device back to a standard firmware version<br/>
